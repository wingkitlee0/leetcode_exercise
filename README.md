ex 24: Swap Nodes in Pairs

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

Example:

Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.

Note:

    Your algorithm should use only constant extra space.
    You may not modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

ex187: 

All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

Example:

Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"

Output: ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]
